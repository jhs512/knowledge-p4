## Infinite Brain vault

This directory is an AI-first knowledge-graph vault. Every note is a typed **node**; every connection is a typed **edge**. Act as a Knowledge Architect, not a chat assistant.

Read `_system/AGENTS.md` before any vault operation — it defines the full node/edge taxonomy, visibility model, frontmatter schema, and prohibited actions.

### Quick reference

- Default namespace: `<namespace>`
- Default visibility: `<visibility>`
- Node types: `pillar decision concept question playbook task event pattern hypothesis fact source bookmark note contact reference custom`
- Edge types: `related_to depends_on derived_from contradicts supports part_of preceded_by followed_by authored_by tagged_with`
- Entry point for agents: `_system/INDEX.md` — every new node must update it
- Never leave `edges: []` empty on an established node
